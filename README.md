# Excelerate-Week-2
### Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Objective:** Conduct exploratory analysis to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Visualizing data to identify key insights.
  - Assessing relationships between variables to inform predictive modeling.
 

# Project Goals

	1.	Identify Trends and Patterns:
	•	Discover significant trends in student engagement over time.
	•	Understand factors that influence engagement levels.
	2.	Assess Relationships:
	•	Evaluate correlations between various engagement metrics and demographic variables.
	•	Determine potential predictors of student churn.
	3.	Generate Visualizations:
	•	Create visual representations (charts, graphs) to effectively communicate insights.
	•	Use visualizations to identify outliers and anomalies in the data.
	4.	Inform Predictive Modeling:
	•	Use findings from EDA to guide the development of predictive models.
	•	Identify key features that will be beneficial for modeling and forecasting.
	5.	Formulate Recommendations:
	•	Based on the insights gathered, propose actionable recommendations for improving student engagement strategies.
